A positive integer is a palindrome if its decimal representation (without leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and 349943 are palindromes. 

A range of integers is interesting if it contains an even number of palindromes. The range [L, R], with L <= R, is defined as the sequence of integers from L to R (inclusive): (L, L+1, L+2, ..., R-1, R). L and R are the range's first and last numbers. 

The range [L1,R1] is a subrange of [L,R] if L <= L1 <= R1 <= R. Your job is to determine how many interesting subranges of [L,R] there are.

INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file is one test case. Each test case will contain two positive integers, L and R (in that order), separated by a space. eg. 

1 2
1 7
87 88

OUTPUT SAMPLE:

For each line of input, print out the number of interesting subranges of [L,R] eg. 

1
12
